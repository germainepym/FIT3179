                            A ranking system is necessary because there are millions of students around the world that deserves to know which education institute is best for them.
                            The map below illustrates the amount of students in each country, normalised to their respective population. <b>Iceland</b> and <b>Australia</b> is shown to have the <b>highest</b> 
                            amount of students for every 10,000 people in their country while <b>Indonesia</b> and <b>Nigeria</b> has the <b>least</b> amount of students for every 10,000 people in their country.

                    <p>The <b>donut chart</b> on the right illustrates the top 100 universities and shows which country is the better destination for education while the <b>radial chart</b> on the left shows the Top 10 Universities in the world in 2016. According
                        to the data presented, <b>United States of America</b> is the country that contains the most high ranking universities. <br><br>
                        
                        Remark: California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich)

                    <p>The <b>bubble plot</b> above illustrates the ranking scores obtained by the top 10 universities in 2016. This shows the scores of each category
                    that each university that has respectively obtained. The <b>worst</b> performing scores are both <b>income</b> and <b>international</b>, however since they weigh
                    the least out of the 5 scores, it did not affect the overall scores heavily. 
                    
                    However, through this illustration we can see why these universities are high ranking.

                        Through this chart, we can see that eventhough Caltech scored the lowest score for international, they were still ranked number 1 
                    because they performed really well on teaching, citations and research scores.<br><br>
                
                    Students should consider applying to these universities if they would like to make a huge contribution or breakthrough in their respective fields

                    universities perform poorly on the research score with that category having the lowest median score of 22.1 out of the other 4 categories. This shows that 
                most universities with the few exceptions of the top universities in the world fail to develope and publish substantial and well perceived by academic peers. </p>

                    <p> The <b>scatter plot matrix</b> shows the correlation between the 3 most important scores when in comes to evaluating a high ranking university.
                    According to the matrix, <b>research and teaching are both correlated</b> to each other because the plot looks like a straight line. Teaching and research
                    are correlated to each other because the university uses the same resources, facilities, and personnel, producing teaching and research together.
                        <br><br>
                    While there is less of a correlation between research and citation and also between citation and teaching.  </p>
