                            A ranking system is necessary because there are millions of students around the world that deserves to know which education institute is best for them.
                            The map is normalized for each country's respective population: How many students are there per 10,000 population. <br><br>

                            <b>Iceland</b> and <b>Australia</b> is shown to have the highest amount of students for every 10,000 people in their 
                            country while <b>Indonesia</b> and <b>Nigeria</b> has the least amount of students for every 10,000 people in their country.

                        It is seen that most universities <b>perform poorly on the research score</b> with that category having the lowest median score of 22.1 out of the other 4 categories. 
                        This shows that most universities with the few exceptions of the top universities in the world fail to develope and publish substantial and well perceived by academic peers. </p>

                    <p> The <b>scatter plot matrix</b> shows the correlation between the 3 most important scores when in comes to evaluating a high ranking university.
                    <b>Research and teaching are both correlated</b>. This can be explained as university uses the same resources, facilities, and personnel, producing teaching and research together.
                   
                    However, it seems that there is less of a correlation between research and citation and also between citation and teaching seen through this scatterplot matrix.  </p>
